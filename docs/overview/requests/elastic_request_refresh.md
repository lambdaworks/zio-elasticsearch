This request is used for refreshing Elasticsearch index.

In order to use the `Refresh` request import the following:
```scala
import zio.elasticsearch.ElasticRequest.RefreshRequest
import zio.elasticsearch.ElasticRequest.refresh
// this import is required for using `IndexName`, `IndexPattern` and `MultiIndex`
import zio.elasticsearch._
```

You can create a `Refresh` request using the `refresh` method in the following manner:
```scala
val request: RefreshRequest = refresh(selectors = IndexName("index"))
```

If you want to refresh more indices, you can use `refresh` method this way:
```scala
val requestWithMultiIndex: RefreshRequest = refresh(selectors = MultiIndex.names(IndexName("index1"), IndexName("index2")))
```

If you want to refresh all indices, you can use `refresh` method with `IndexPattern` this way:
```scala
val requestWithIndexPattern: RefreshRequest = refresh(selectors = IndexPattern("_all"))
```

You can find more information about `Refresh` request [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/indices-refresh.html).
