The `Match` query is a type of query that searches for a provided text, number, date or boolean value.
This is the standard query for performing a full-text search, including options for fuzzy matching.

In order to use the `Match` query import the following:

```scala
import zio.elasticsearch.query.MatchQuery
import zio.elasticsearch.ElasticQuery._
```

You can create a `Match` query using the `matches` method in the following manner:
```scala
val query: MatchQuery = matches(field = "message", value = "this is a test")
```

You can create a [type-safe](https://lambdaworks.github.io/zio-elasticsearch/overview/overview_zio_prelude_schema) `Match` query using the `matches` method in the following manner:
```scala
val query: MatchQuery = matches(field = Document.message, value = "this is a test")
```
